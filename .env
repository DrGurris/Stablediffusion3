POSITIVE_PROMPT="Transform the 3D ultrasound image to focus exclusively on the soft, rounded face of a newborn baby. Capture an extremely round and plump face with chubby cheeks that fill most of the image, a very small and rounded nose with minimal definition, and large, wide-set eyes with a gentle, innocent, and unfocused expression. The chin should be almost non-existent, giving the face a compact and very round appearance. Emphasize the smooth, soft skin texture typical of a newborn, with no visible blemishes, wrinkles, or adult-like contours. The lips should be tiny and subtly pursed, with a naturally pouty look. Eyebrows should be barely visible, appearing only as faint lines to softly frame the eyes. Use delicate, diffused lighting that adds gentle highlights around the cheeks and forehead to create a soft, lifelike glow. Ensure that the background resembles a warm, soft-focus environment, like a baby’s crib or nursery room, with subtle pastel tones to enhance the softness and innocence of the image. The final result should focus solely on the baby’s face, closely resembling the round, soft, and gentle features of a real newborn baby."

NEGATIVE_PROMPT="Avoid any part of the body besides the face, as well as any mature or adult-like facial characteristics, such as defined cheekbones, a pronounced chin, strong jawline, or angular features. Exclude expressions or gaze that appear focused, intense, or mature. Avoid well-defined or thick eyebrows, detailed eyelids, visible eyelashes, or any shape that resembles a structured or elongated face. Remove any shadows or lighting effects that create depth or emphasize sharp lines. Do not include elements like makeup, gloss, visible teeth, or pronounced lips that would resemble an older face. Exclude backgrounds that are not soft, warm, or suitable for a baby, avoiding any textures, high contrast, or items that detract from a calm, nursery-like setting."
